# FlippoIO – Native Windows Alternative To Caia
FlippoIO is an alternative to Caia for the game Flippo, that runs on Windows. The goal of this project is to bring offline codecup testing to the Windows platform while at the same time providing an improvement to Caia.

Some of its features include:
* Multithreading: all matches and competitions are spread over the available cores by default, without the need for a separate script that creates a ton of little other scripts.
* Supports Java out of the box: there is no need to copy a separate wrapper for each JAR file.
* Highly configurable: settings such as how many threads to use, the time limit, how many matches to play in a competition, and many more are easily configurable.
* Uses a command-based syntax instead of the manager.txt file to give the user full control in a human readable manner.
* No more need for Cygwin and the annoyances that can come with its installation.
* All in one executable: FlippoIO comes as a single executable that requires no installation.
